It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

Kain and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.  All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the interest of source tree size.  In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:  Bobby Bingham John Spencer Nicholas J. Kain Rich Felker Richard Pennington Stefan Kristiansson Szabolcs Nagy  all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.  This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers. All rights reserved.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.
